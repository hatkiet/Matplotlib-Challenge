# Matplotlib-Challenge
I have completed "Module 5: Matplotlib-Challenge" using the concepts and knowledge from lectures and activities in UPENN Data Science Bootcamp. 
For this project, I created a new repository named "Matplotlib-Challenge." Inside this repository, you can find a Jupyter Notebook Python scripting file named 
"Pymaceuticals_starter_Kiet.ipynb" that runs the analysis, along with a sub-folder named "data" which contains the Data CSV files for this study.
The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals’ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

Although I worked on this project alone, I also have plan to discuss it with our study group. Additionally, I sought assistance from Google and ChatGPT 
to help me find errors in my code and make it more descriptive and easier to understand.
